* **Frontend Web App** -public facing website
* **Azure Container Registry** -the container registry, accessible only within the VNET through private endpoint
* **Azure Key Vault** responsible to securely store the secrets/credentials for the PaaS services to be access by the web applications
* **Application Insights** to provide monitoring and visibility for the health and performance of the application
* **Azure SQL Database** the Microsoft SQL Server database to be used by the applications
* **Data Storage Account** the Storage Account that will contain the application data / blob files
* **Jumphost VM** the virtual machine to have access to the resources in the virtual network
